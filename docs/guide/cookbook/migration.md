## 0. Introduction
Ever wonder if _the great legendary software_ has been invented once and for all and never needed an update since it was too great from its beginning? Even _Homer_ nodded that _Vue Storefront_ is such case, however, when _the great great legendary_ gets in the way, you should yield to it for the better.

Handling migration or any sort of upgrade for a system takes developer's life. The more you had great times with previous version, the griever developer's concerns will likely be because complexity for upgrade will only gets worse due to the character of upgrades; _Removal of bad structure_. 

Remember when _Angular.js_ upgrade to _Angular_ was announced? A great number of developers forever left _Angular_ community since the upgrade showed no mercy at all with barely no backward compatibility.

One might ask why fear for upgrade when it's a click away. If you say so, I bet you are not a developer who does the actual job or precisely speaking, _magic_ if I may say. 

Many attempts were made to mitigate such headache disaster for developers. This chapter will show you how we did it our way for that matter. And please don't forget, upgrades are here to help you in the end, not torture you. _Don't worry, be happy!_
